# web-scraping-ATCC
Learning-purpose code showing a simplified approach to scrap one of the ATCC pages with Python and BeautifulSoup.

I started learning how to scrap with BeautifulSoup at the Wikimedia Hackathon (Techstorm) taking place in The Hague (October 2018) and I wanted to give it a try with a basic example to understand the concepts. I chose one of the pages containing information about animal cell lines. This approach could/should be scalated to retrieve more information.


ATCC or the American Type Culture Collection is a nonprofit organization which collects, stores, and distributes standard reference microorganisms, cell lines and other materials for research and development. Established in 1925 to serve as a national center for depositing and distributing microbiological specimens, ATCC has since grown to distribute in over 150 countries. It is now the largest general culture collection in the world (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATCC_(company)).
